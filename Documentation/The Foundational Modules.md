# The Foundational Modules
There are three foundational modules that exist to define
how characters, organizations and locations work at the very
basic level. All of these modules are hardcoded into BaWo
for security reasons, so what follows below is **only** for
the purpose of better understanding the inner workings of BaWo
and for exemplifying module design.

# The Foundational Character Module
The Foundational Character Module is the module from
which all other modules make sense, and it is the central
module driving the BaWo AI.
