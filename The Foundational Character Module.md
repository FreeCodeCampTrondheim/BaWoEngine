# The Foundational Character Module
The Foundational Character Module is the module from
which all other modules make sense, and it is the central
module driving the BaWo AI. This module is hardcoded into
BaWo for optimization and security.

## Foundational Character Module JSON
Below is a description of the module as a JSON structure,
which can be used both to understand the working of
BaWo better, and as an example of BaWo module design.

Note that this JSON doesn't actually exist anywhere as
a file, it is just what it would've looked like if it
wasn't hardcoded.
